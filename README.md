# Social Network API

## Description

This is a social network API designed for a social media startup. The API uses a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to handle large amounts of unstructured data, providing efficient and scalable operations for a social network platform.

## User Story

AS a social media startup  
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database  
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data  

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API:
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
  - THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
  - THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
  - THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
  - THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
